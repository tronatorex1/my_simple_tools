###General GitHub Upload Source

I have gathered These general Internet sources' codes to centralize examples I can use later on during any development anywhere.
Some of this information can be retrieved from forums and blogs. I wanted to collect them and place them in an easy-to-access place. 
There are examples in the range of accessing data analysis procedures and libraries to access to rest APIs, log usage, list operations, and more.
Names are self-explanatory for each file/example.
