Housekeeping using Linux's commands

Why? Just because shell scripting and Unix/Linux commands are a good approach to execute things in these O.S. If the pythonist prefers to go for python's operations, that is quite OK. It all comes down to the liking of the user or developer. I have created also a pure Python procedure to clean files up, just in case the user prefers to go for the native Python code and not mix Python and other scripting languages. So, if you're looking for a way to communicate with Unix/Linux from a Python program, this might be an example you can use while developing your skills in Python programming same way I am developing mine :)

This code attempts only to clean old files but not completely delete them. They first are compressed and then, those old ones are removed to free disk/FS space.

Hope this will help you as it did to me :)
